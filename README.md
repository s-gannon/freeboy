A free and open source wrist mounted computer. This project intends to use as many free and open source parts as possible, or at least have the main parts of this project (computer, code, models, etc.) be free and open source so that it can be adapted to use different parts if the parts used in the original project are no longer manufactured.

I'm going to use **OpenSCAD** as the 3D modelling software to design any of the 3D printed parts. The single board computer (SBC) I intend to use is the **Libre Renegade** by the people behind the **Libre Computer Project**. Most or all of the code will be written from scratch, with potential exceptions being graphics libraries (SDL2, etc.) depending on what route I want to take with the graphics in the program.
